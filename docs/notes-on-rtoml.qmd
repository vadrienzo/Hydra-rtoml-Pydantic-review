# Notes on `rtoml`.

A little thoughts on different examples:

### `NoneType` not handle it at the point of loading.

When dumping a python dictionary with `NoneType` values 
into a TOML file, results into a `null` string (which makes "sense").
The problem arise when loading, when the TOML file is load, the expected
value was a `NoneType` but turned out to be the string `null`. In my opininon
it would make sense to parse a flag saying that you want to handle `NoneTypes`.
Only when `True`, it would search for special string, such as `null`, `nil` 
or `None`, and turn those keys into `NoneType`.
